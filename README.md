## To View This Project

| You should: |
| ----------|
| Clone the git repo to your computer. |

_Although the traditional housing market is well served by apps like Zillow and Trulia, there are very few automated resources for sellers and buyers who want to do business without a realtor. This app links both parties. Currently, I am working on the MVP as my capstone project. Features in progress, additional features, and features which would be implemented past the capstone, are outlined below._

_I determined two personas : The buyer and the seller, and a short list of features they might both want._
